# Frostgrave Wizard Randomizer
Create a random Wizard for [Frostgrave: Second Edition](https://www.josephamccullough.com/frostgrave/)

## How does it work?
As simple as it sounds. Navigate to [the website](https://piartz.github.io/frostgrave-wizard-randomizer/), click on generate, and you will have a random wizard class with 8 random spells, based on the current rules of Wizard building.

## Why should I randomize my wizards?
* Frostgrave was conceived as a narrative game. Over the years, thousands of players and games have revealed some ways to optimize your choices in character creation, making overpowered combinations of classes and spells being used more often than others. A game that is maintained by a single author is very difficult to balance (even if that author is Joseph A. McCullough!). Random wizards enable epic stories over being competitive. 
* Random wizards open the door to chaotic characters, making the tactical challenge unique every time. How can I find synergies between my spell list? How can I overcome the weaknesses of a non-optimal wizard?
* Obtaining new spells during a campaign game takes precedence. A wizard's life is devoted to seeking arcane knowledge. Knowing almost everything you need from the beginning makes this journey way less interesting. 
* Quick-games. For fast setup, non-campaign games, you can randomly generate your wizard to save time. My playgroup has experienced that, for a single game with no characters created in advance, selecting wizard spells is the most time-consuming process, sometimes taking more time than playing an actual single game.

## What else do I need to start playing?
Assuming you have your rulebook, miniatures, scenery, measurements, and dice, you will also need a warband and optionally (but highly recommended) an apprentice. For simplicity, you can choose your apprentice to have the same spells as your wizard, but remember to apply the +2 penalizers. 

## Are there any online tools that you can recommend?
Certainly! 
* [Grave Tool](https://www.gravetool.com/) can be very useful once you have generated a random class and spells. You can create your warband after knowing which spells you will have available, and check its information and difficulty class. Remember to include the +2 penalizer for aligned spells, and the +4 penalizer for neutral spells, as Grave Tool does not do it automatically. 
* If you are playing a campaign, it is recommended that you document the progression of your character. I recommend to have a digital PDF character sheet, such as [this one](https://www.ospreypublishing.com/media/2urpdqrz/frostgrave-warband-sheet-v2.pdf)

## Do you accept contributions?
It would be awesome. Feel free to create a Pull Request. It would be interesting to show difficulty classes of spellcasting, with already-applied modifiers for aligned and neutral spells. The UI could also look better. Any other suggestions are valid and worth looking at.
